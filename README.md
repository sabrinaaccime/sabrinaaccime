## Hello <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm a Fullstack Developer base in Seattle, WA with a background in Computer Science and a love for all things web. 

I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces—mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm especially focused on creating mobile-first designs that are accessible, consistent, and easy to use.

I’m detail-oriented, love solving problems, and enjoy working with others to bring ideas to life. Whether it’s crafting high-quality landing pages or collaborating on UX improvements, I’m always up for the challenge. I'm excited to keep learning, growing, and contributing to awesome engineering teams.

Outside of work, I love keeping up with the latest trends in fashion and interior design. I'm a bit of a gym rat, I teach boxing, and I'm usually out roller skating when the weather’s nice.
